## 🚀 How It Works

- The navbar starts with a transparent background.
- As the user scrolls, JavaScript calculates the scroll percentage and updates the navbar’s background color dynamically.
- Multiple colors can be set in a palette, allowing smooth transitions between them.
- The navbar also changes style slightly when scrolled (e.g. solid color + shadow).
- Hovering over links changes their background and text color for interactivity.
